# mvc.js TODO

+ npm package
+ Allow specific dependencies to be injected
+ Shell script for generating projects, building files, etc.
+ Assess how templating will work, define parent containers?
+ Look into possible value inheritence/conflicts between modules. Consider a way to define certain variables as protected.
+ Real use of plugin to determine how well extending the api works.
+ Fix cucumber tests, need to work out a less hacky approach to using watir, remove use of examples.
+ Better automation of gh-pages (getting started, examples, etc.)
+ Refactor and DRY out cucumber step definitions
