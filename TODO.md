# mvc.js TODO

+ Better hello world example - needs to be very clear and simple. (messaging widget?)
+ Assess how templating will work, define parent containers?
+ Look into possible value inheritence/conflicts between modules. Consider a way to define certain variables as protected.
+ Real use of plugin to determine how well extending the api works.
+ Fix cucumber tests, need to work out a less hacky approach to using watir, remove use of examples.
+ TDD example (video player, todo list?)
+ Better automation of gh-pages (getting started, examples, etc.)
+ Refactor and DRY out cucumber step definitions
